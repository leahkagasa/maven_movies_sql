**Customer Value Analysis , Maven Movies**

This project uses SQL and Tableau to identify high value customers in a fictional movie rental business. I created a custom reporting view in MySQL by joining five tables and segmenting customers into tiers based on total payments. The data was exported to Tableau for visualizations including top spenders, tier distribution, and geographic revenue insights.

Tools: MySQL Workbench, Tableau Public

Skills Demonstrated: SQL joins, aggregation, CASE logic, view creation, dashboard design
